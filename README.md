# Power BI Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project serves as a demonstration of what Power BI can do rather than providing a step-by-step guide to creating the visuals.

## Dataset Description

**Note:** The dataset contains dummy data for demonstration purposes. There are different Excel files containing different datasets.

### Example Dataset:
- **First Apocalypse Food Prep** (Excel contains: Bottled Water, Canned Vegetables, Dried Beans, and Rice.)

These products were purchased from three different retailers:
- **Walmart**
- **Costco**
- **Target**

The data covers purchases made over three months:
- **January**
- **February**
- **March**

## Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to determine:
1. If we are spending **less money overall at one location** for all products, allowing us to optimize future shopping and save money.
2. If specific products are **cheaper at different locations**, so we can strategically shop at different stores based on product pricing.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and analysis
- **Excel/CSV Files** for data storage and preprocessing
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for custom calculations
- **Power Query** for data transformation

## Insights & Analysis
The Power BI dashboard will visualize:
- **Total spending by store** to identify the cheapest overall shopping option.
- **Product-wise spending per store** to analyze price variations across different locations.
- **Monthly spending trends** to see if costs fluctuate over time.

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install from [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)
- **Excel or CSV Viewer**: To inspect the datasets before loading them into Power BI

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Steve-gachuiri/Power-BI.git
   ```
2. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard and insights.

## Conclusion
This project helps in making **data-driven shopping decisions** by identifying the best store for overall savings or strategic product-based shopping.
