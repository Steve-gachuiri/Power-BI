# Power BI Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Power BI is a popular data visualization tool within the Microsoft ecosystem. This project analyzes spending data on various goods across different locations to determine the most cost-effective shopping strategy.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on purchases of the following goods:
- **Bottled Water**
- **Canned Vegetables**
- **Dried Beans**
- **Rice**

These products were purchased from three different retailers:
- **Walmart**
- **Costco**
- **Target**

The data covers purchases made over three months:
- **January**
- **February**
- **March**

## Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to determine:
1. If we are spending **less money overall at one location** for all products, allowing us to optimize future shopping and save money.
2. If specific products are **cheaper at different locations**, so we can strategically shop at different stores based on product pricing.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and analysis
- **Excel/CSV Files** for data storage and preprocessing
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for custom calculations
- **Power Query** for data transformation

## Insights & Analysis
The Power BI dashboard will visualize:
- **Total spending by store** to identify the cheapest overall shopping option.
- **Product-wise spending per store** to analyze price variations across different locations.
- **Monthly spending trends** to see if costs fluctuate over time.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Steve-gachuiri/Power-BI.
   ```
2. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard and insights.

## Conclusion
This project helps in making **data-driven shopping decisions** by identifying the best store for overall savings or strategic product-based shopping.
